#Tuxsters - the Awards show in a Laptop
The Tuxsters project was dreamed up by [Dave Hingley] during [OggCamp].  He had an idea that someone could set up a website somewhere that would allow people to submit films, and then get the other members of the site to vote on aspects of those films, with a view winning awards.  Think of this as an Free Software 'Oscars' event that you can run from a laptop.

And that involves everything.  Including the awards themselves.  

Since that initial thought, we've genericised somewhat.  Tuxsters as a platform will be capable of running any number of competition - not just video.  A Song contest or even literature awards could be potentially run using this platform.
